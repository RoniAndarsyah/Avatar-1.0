= User Profiles & Member Directories =

Add beautiful user profiles to your site that display the profile picture and information of your users.​ And create searchable and filterable member directories allowing users to find each other.

We also provide shortcodes to display users avatars and allow users to upload their profile pictures from the front-end of your site.​

We took the pain out of creating user profiles, member directories, forms with our intuitive drag-and-drop builder.

We also provide an advanced form builder that gives you the flexibility to build any type of form. With knowledge of HTML, you code the form in combination with our expressive shortcodes, make it pretty with CSS and we handle the rest.

ProfilePress gives you fine-grained control over what content your users can see based on your protection rules. You can restrict access to pages, child pages, posts, custom post types, categories, tags and custom taxonomies based on their user roles and logged-in status.

ProfilePress also lets you:
